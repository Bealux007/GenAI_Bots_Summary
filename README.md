üìå Project Overview

The GenAI Bots Summary project is an AI model evaluation system designed to compare responses from multiple AI models, rank their effectiveness, and generate a PDF report summarizing the findings. This system enables users to select a "judge model" that evaluates responses from other models, votes on the best responses and assigns scores accordingly.

This project leverages OpenAI models, Gradio for a user-friendly UI, FPDF for PDF generation, and Pydantic for data handling.

Key Features
‚úÖ Compare responses from GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-3.5 Turbo.
‚úÖ Automatically rank models based on voting and scoring.
‚úÖ Generate a PDF report summarizing evaluation results.
‚úÖ User-friendly Gradio-based UI for easy interaction.
‚úÖ Dynamic querying with the ability to judge model responses.


üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows a structured directory format, ensuring modularity and maintainability.
