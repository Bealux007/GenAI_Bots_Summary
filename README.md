ðŸš€ GenAI Bots Summary - AI Model Evaluation System
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The GenAI Bots Summary project is a sophisticated AI model comparison and evaluation system that allows users to analyze the response quality of multiple LLMs (Large Language Models). The system queries various AI models, evaluates their responses, ranks them based on voting and scoring mechanisms, and generates a detailed PDF report summarizing the results.

With the increasing adoption of AI-driven solutions, businesses, researchers, and AI enthusiasts often seek to determine which AI model best suits their use case. This project provides an intuitive, interactive way to compare AI models using real-world queries and an automated judging mechanism.

The project features:

Multi-model query system: Evaluate multiple AI models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5 Turbo).
Voting and scoring system: Rank models based on their performance using AI-driven evaluations.
Automated PDF report generation: Downloadable reports summarizing the evaluation results.
Gradio-based interactive UI: A simple, user-friendly web-based interface.
Extensible design: Can be easily adapted to support more AI models in the future.
